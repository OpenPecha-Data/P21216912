On the Proportions of Stūpas and Suchlike

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Amṛta vijayantu!

Regarding the origin of proportions, The Treasury of All-Encompassing Knowledge says:

On the uncommon level, as taught in the Kālacakra,The stūpa of primordial wisdom corresponds
to:The cross-legged buddha’s lower body in its steps,His abdomen in its dome plinth,His upper
torso in its bulging dome,His throat in its high pavilion, his head up to the ūrṇāIn
its canopy face, and the top of his head in its stacked dharma wheels and crest.Outer, inner
and other thus accord within a single expression.

This explains the origin of the measurements. The antithesis of this, something made haphazardly
without such proportions, will always be objectionable. As the guide to proportions by
Tulku Sangye Lhawang[1] says:

Otherwise, what is fashioned according to your own preferenceWill not inspire faith but waste
resources.If established, it will not inspire devotion but accumulate defilement.If gifted,
it will be unwanted by others and will be a cause of shame.If venerated, it will not inspire
pure vision but disturbed dreams.Having therefore cast aside such innovative, unconventional
styles,The intelligent should take note of proper proportions.

Regarding beautiful, attractive supports for offering[2]with proper measurements, the above-cited
text says:

Well-constructed, proportionate and attractive, it is a field of offering,A support for gathering
the two accumulations of merit and wisdom.

As this indicates, it is vitally important to pay attention to avoiding what is flawed and pursuing
what is positive.

Let us conclude with verse:

Support for accomplishment, surety for attainment,Healer of impairments, breakages, veils and
thought,With billows of offerings to delight the maṇḍalaAnd baliṃta of fourfold understanding,Magical
focus for transforming into all that is desirable,Gateway to the auspicious
provision of food and the like,With the key point from oral instructions of five types of
ringsel,With the special quality of profound secret mantra,All the oral instructions of the
omniscient guru,And with the splendid motivation of a wish to benefit allMay the two glorious
accumulations be spontaneously achieved!
